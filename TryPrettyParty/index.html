          <p class="txtlincon">I was SO excited when I found extensions that look exactly like the hair of a certain A list celebrity singer in her music videos that I had to write a review about it!</p>
          <p class="txtlincon">I was never much of an extensions gal until I decided to try these amazing ponytail extensions I'd found on the internet. (Pretty much the exact same look that you see this singer wearing in all her concert and music videos!)</p>
          <p class="txtlincon">I'd always thought that her Vogue-approved ponytail would've been expensive AF - I mean, she's worn the high ponytail style in all of her music videos, her hair is almost as famous as she is! I’m sure you’ve seen them—everyone has!</p>

          <p class="txtlincon">So I searched for the same hairstyle extensions on Google - I thought that it would cost me an arm and a leg. But I was wrong.</p>
          <p class="txtlincon">I ordered them on TRYPRETTYPARTY - a cool new LA-based beauty company that is getting a lot of buzz by, they say, helping you create affordable celebrity looks in 30 seconds or less. The company is apparently super hot because they created salon-quality, patent-pending DIY hair extensions that let you take control of your style without spending hours in a salon or blowing your entire paycheque. The style I got was "The Ruby".</p>
          <p class="txtlincon">Apparently, millions of women came across the product after seeing it on TV shows like Access Hollywood, Celebrity Page and the CMT Music Awards.</p>

              <p class="txteve">Even Kellie Pickler, American Idol Finalist, actress and country music artist, has been using this hair extension. So, all of the buzz around the product was causing it to fly off the shelf.</p>
              <p class="txtiwa">I was impressed by Kellie’s look, and I started thinking—are other celebrity musicians wearing TRYPRETTYPARTY extensions too? The Ruby and another style, The Roxy, sure looked like the hair I was seeing in those music videos! I had to try it out for myself - so I ordered it online and it got shipped to my door within a few days! <span class="asterisc">*</span> </p>

        <section class="">
          <div class="lined-content"></div>
            <p>Well, the product has managed to sell out every month. It’s also built up a loyal base of followers - from celebrities to models to women and girls of all ages. There’s been a huge buzz on social media too.</p>
            <p>The extension features 30 inches of salon quality, heat friendly fiber that’s powered by patented StyleFlex® Technology.</p>
            <p>The company that developed and patented it, TRYPRETTYPARTY, designed it to have the flexibility you need to style your hair in all sorts of ways, or change your look whenever you want, perfectly fast.</p>
            <p>On their website, I saw that the product already had some compelling 5-star reviews. So, I was eager to try it out.</p>
            <p>However, I was a little skeptical because word has it the best extensions are actually quite a bit more expensive. Plus, I wondered whether they had a color that would look right with my own hair.</p>
            <p>But since the price tag for this product was reasonable, I felt encouraged enough to test it out. I ordered the dark brown because I thought it would be the best match. I WAS ALL IN!</p>

              <p>My first thought when I removed it from the package was how life-like it felt. The colors also blended in, and it matched perfectly with my real hair.</p>
              <p>It looks EXACTLY like the tutorial videos, and it felt like real human hair.</p>
              <p>Both good signs!</p>
              <p>So, I sat in front of my mirror and pulled my natural hair into a tight bun, then applied and secured the StyleFlex® extension by placing it through my bun and wrapping it around my real hair. <span class="asterisc">*</span> </p>

            It took 30 seconds to secure it around my normal ponytail. I felt bomb AF and I couldn't stop swishing, and snapping photos of it. All of a sudden - I had that certain celebrity singer’s signature look - at less than half of the price I thought I'd be paying. And the way it attaches on top of my hair is really unique, no beads or tape or clips, no damage to my hair or scalp, and because it’s on top of my hair instead of underneath, the color looks perfect. Not only that, but it’s a big time saver—no salon visits, no time-consuming applications. It really does take only 30 seconds to style or change my hair!
          </p>
          <p class="txtlincon2">A month later, I'm STILL excited by how awesome it looks and how durable it is - and I'll soon be wearing it to a concert where I think my hair will be a perfect match for the singer’s - I don't think there's a more suitable occasion than that!</p>
          <p class="txtlincon2">Extensions are rarely inexpensive for good quality, so if you want to channel that iconic 30” ponytail this year, I'd definitely grab one before it's too late.</p>
          <p class="txtlincon2">Safe to say, "The Ruby" will be selling out at some point today because they're now offering the option of having split payments. Get shopping, people!</p>

                          Privacy Policy for www.tryprettyparty.com
                          The privacy of our visitors to www.tryprettyparty.com is important to us.
                          At www.tryprettyparty.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit www.tryprettyparty.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
                          Log Files
                          As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
                          Cookies and Web Beacons
                          We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.
                          We also use third party advertisements on www.tryprettyparty.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
                          DoubleClick DART cookies
                          We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
                          You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
                          Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
